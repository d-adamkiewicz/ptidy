# the idea is to each project have in its main directory 'project.yaml' file that describes it
# this file content is read by 'ptidy.py'
files:
#you can use aliases if you want use them in rest of the file
 - &a1 index.php
#you can put files in subdirs 
 - &a2 css/1/style.css
 - output.php
 - &a3 process.php
#if not this will be moved 
 - project.yaml
ignore:
#only files in main dir eg 'out/.cache' won't work
 files:
 - .cache
 - log.txt
#only first-level subdirs eg 'logs/1' won't work
 dirs:
 - logs
 - .git
